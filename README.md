1Ô∏è‚É£ import numpy as np
Definition: NumPy is a library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for arrays and mathematical operations.

Purpose in the chatbot:

Used for handling numerical data efficiently, especially when working with machine learning models.

Helps in storing and processing large datasets like word embeddings or feature vectors.

Can be used for mathematical operations, such as calculating similarity scores or probabilities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
Definition: TfidfVectorizer converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which measures word importance in a document relative to a dataset.

Purpose in the chatbot:

Converts user input (text) into numerical form so that machine learning models can process it.

Helps the chatbot understand the importance of words and rank them accordingly.

Improves response selection by filtering out common words (like "the","is") and focusing on meaningful ones.

3Ô∏è‚É£ from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
Definition: Logistic Regression is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

Purpose in the chatbot:

Used to classify user input into predefined categories (e.g., greetings, food-related queries, weather queries).

Helps the chatbot decide what type of response to provide based on input classification.

Trains on labelled chatbot data to improve response accuracy over time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
Definition: make_pipeline is a function that combines multiple processing steps (like vectorization and classification) into a single streamlined workflow.

Purpose in the chatbot:

Simplifies chatbot development by chaining together different processing steps (e.g., converting text into TF-IDF and classifying it using Logistic Regression).

Makes it easier to train and deploy models without handling each step separately.

5Ô∏è‚É£ from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
Definition: cosine_similarity measures the similarity between two text vectors based on the cosine of the angle between them.

Purpose in the chatbot:

Helps find the closest matching response by comparing user input with predefined responses.

Improves chatbot accuracy by ranking responses based on similarity rather than just keyword matching.

Used in retrieval-based chatbots to fetch the best response from a knowledge base.

üìå How It Works in a Chatbot
User inputs text ‚Üí "What‚Äôs the weather like today?"

TF-IDF Vectorization ‚Üí Converts text into a numerical representation.

Logistic Regression Classification ‚Üí Determines the category (e.g., ‚ÄúWeather Query‚Äù).

Response Selection (Cosine Similarity) ‚Üí Finds the most relevant response based on similarity.

Chatbot Replies ‚Üí "I can't check live weather, but you can try a weather app!"
